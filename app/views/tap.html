            <strong>The Tibetan Association of Philadelphia (TAP)</strong> is a registered 501(c) (3) non-profit organization, founded in 2002 in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We strive to preserve and promote unique Tibetan cultural traditions and further the just cause of Tibet, and consider His Holiness the Dalai Lama as the Spiritual leader of Tibet. We are committed to the principle of non-violence, and recognize the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) as the legitimate representative of Tibet.
        </p>
            <h2 class="secondary-h2">Our Aims and Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To preserve and promote the Tibetan people’s distinct religious and cultural heritage by educating the younger generation of Tibetan-Americans about their history, religion and culture, and by passing on knowledge of spoken and written Tibetan.</li>
                <li>To raise awareness about the Chinese occupation of Tibet and the plight of the Tibetan people.</li>
                <li>To strengthen unity among Tibetans.</li>
                <li>To promote His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s message of love, compassion and kindness.</li>
            </ul>


        <h2>Tibetan Cultural & Language School</h2>
        <p>The centerpiece of our programs is our Tibetan language school, held on Sundays from 10:00 am - 1:00 pm. Children are taught to read, write and speak Tibetan. They also study the history and cultural heritage of Tibet, and learn songs and dances. Our Sunday school was formed in April of 2011. Currently, there are eight volunteer teachers and 24 students in the program.</p>

        <h2>March 10 Tibetan Uprising Day</h2>
        <p>
            Tibet was an Independent nation before 1949. China illegally occupied Tibet in 1950. On March 10, 1959, tens of thousands of Tibetans took to the streets of Lhasa, Tibet’s capital, rising up against China’s illegal invasion and occupation of their homeland. They surrounded the Potala Palace, the home of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, to protect him and the future of the Tibetan nation. But Chinese forces slaughtered people in the streets. His Holiness fled to India for refuge. As a result of China’s occupation, hundreds of thousands of Tibetans have perished, and around 6,000 monasteries have been destroyed. The Chinese government continues to restrict Tibetans’ rights, infringing on their freedoms of speech, press, association, and religious and other cultural practices. To this day, Tibetans have been struggling to regain their freedom from China. Since 2008, tragically, 145 Tibetans have self-immolated, as a plea for freedom in Tibet and for the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet, which China forbids. Our community members--like every Tibetan community in the world-- commemorate this day each year to protest and create broader awareness about the ongoing occupation and cultural repression.
        </p>

        <h2>Lhakar</h2>
        <p>
            Lhakar is a Tibetan word. It literally means “White Wednesday,” and is occasionally referred to as “pure dedication.” It refers to the self-reliant Tibetan movement which appeared after the 2008 Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. The movement is based on a strategy of nonviolence, applied through social, cultural, and economic activities. Every Wednesday, our community members make a special effort to wear traditional clothes, speak Tibetan, and patronize Tibetan businesses. In addition, on one Wednesday each month we gather to pray together,  and to organize events to promote and strengthen cultural identity and community cohesion.
        </p>

        <h2>His Holiness the Dalai Lama</h2>
        <p>His Holiness the Dalai Lama is, to Tibetans, the heart and soul of Tibet, and a living symbol of love and kindness in the world. His teachings on Buddhism and moral values guide us in our community’s various activities and as we interact with different groups and organizations to spread the message of peace and kindness.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Activities</h2>
            <p> We also participate in numerous cultural activities and special events in the Philadelphia area to showcase our unique arts, culture and heritage. For example, annually, we participate in the  July 4th parade, celebrate His Holiness’ birthday, and organize the Tibetan Bazaar/Fest, one of the most-visited festivals of any of Philadelphia’s many ethnic communities.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Center Project</h2>
        <p>
            We are trying to raise money to establish a Tibetan Temple and Cultural Center in Philadelphia.  Our goal is to purchase a Temple and Cultural Center located in Northeast Philadelphia. This Temple is currently owned by the Kalmyk Buddhist community and was visited by the Dalai Lama twice, in 1990 and 2008.
        </p>
        
         <b>Objectives of the Project</b>

        <ul>
            <li>To establish a Community Cultural Center to be considered as our home, a place where we can preserve and promote our unique Tibetan cultural heritage.</li>
            <li>To have classrooms for our Sunday Tibetan language school where we teach our youth to read and write Tibetan.</li>
            <li> To have a base from which to produce public programs and offer services to strengthen and sustain our community. We will aim to promote compassion, kindness, peace and religious harmony by sharing the values inherent in the practice of Tibetan arts and culture.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Project Budget</b><br />
        Temple and Cultural Center building purchase: $400,000.00<br />
        Renovation: $150,000.00<br />
        Total: $550,000.00<br />
