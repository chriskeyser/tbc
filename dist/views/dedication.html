May I be a guard for those who are protectorless,
A guide for those who journey on the road.
For those who wish to cross the water,
may I be a boat, a raft, a bridge.

May I be an isle for those who yearn for land,
A lamp for those who long for light;
For all who need a resting place, a bed;
For those who need a servant, may I be their slave.
May I be the wishing jewel, the vase of wealth,
A word of power and the supreme healing.

May I be the tree of miracles,
For every being the abundant cow.
Just like the earth and space itself
And all the other might elements,
for boundless multitudes of beings
May I always be the ground of life, the source of varied sustenance.

Thus for everything that lives,
As far as are the limits of the sky,
May I be constantly their source of livelihood
Until they pass beyond all sorrow.

Cultivating a close, warm-hearted feeling for others automatically puts the mind at ease. This helps remove whatever fears or insecurities we may have and gives us the strength to cope with any obstacles we encounter. It is the ultimate source of success in life." Reflected in his every action and word, no matter how small, or where or to whom spoken, we too hope that this website, and all the activities reflected here, help to cultivate this intention, this warm-hearted feeling for you and all who visit. And from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you. </p> <p> <span style="font-style:italic">Committee, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama Visit to Philadelphia, City of Sisterly and Brotherly Love, October 26 & 27, 2015</span> </p> </div> </div>
