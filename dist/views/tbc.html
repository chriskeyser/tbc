And thank you for reading. The Chenrezig Tibetan Buddhist Center of Philadelphia (TBC) is a non-sectarian organization, <a href="http://www.tibetanbuddhist.org/brief-history-our-center">founded in 1991</a>, open to buddhists and non-buddhists alike. The main goal of our Center is to cultivate compassion and loving kindness, based on the philosophy and methods taught by his Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso. Our educational focus is to teach and share the principles of Tibetan Buddhist thought and practice. </p> <h2>Our Spiritual Director</h2> <img src="/images/inside-tbc.b560c0d6.jpg" class="img-responsive img-dropshadow img-inside"> <p> Our Spiritual Director is Venerable Lama Losang Samten. Born in Ribuce Chang, Tibet in 1953, Losang and his family escaped to India in 1959 following the Chinese invasion of Tibet, and in 1985 earned the degree of Master of Buddhist Sutra and Tantra Studies at Namgyal Monastery in Dharamsala, India, the monastery of his Holiness the Dalai Lama. Losang is also the founder and Spiritual Director of Chenrezig Tibetan Buddhist Centers in <a href="http://www.nevadadharma.net/tahoe.html">Lake Tahoe, Nevada</a>; <a href="http://www.ctbcc.com/Welcome.html">El Paso, Texas</a>; and <a href="http://www.chenrezigcenter.com/">Hartford, Connecticut</a>. Losang resides in Philadelphia when he is not visiting our sibling Centers, or invited to create sand mandalas around the United States and Canada. You can read more about Lama Losang on our <a href="http://www.tibetanbuddhist.org/venerable-lama-losang-samten">website</a>, on Losang's website at <a href="http://www.losangsamten.com/">www.losangsamten.com</a>or on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Losang-Samten/150106282678?ref=aymt_homepage_panel">community page</a> on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Losang-Samten/150106282678?ref=aymt_homepage_panel">Facebook</a>. </p> <h2>Offerings and Activities</h2> <p> It's not at all necessary or even important to be a Buddhist to enjoy our many programs and activities.
