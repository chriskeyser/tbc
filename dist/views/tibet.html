<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-1 secondary-page"> <h1>The Country of Tibet</h1> <img src="/images/tibet/tibet1-hi.4258b485.jpg" class="img-responsive img-dropshadow img-inside"> <p> The country of Tibet comprises an area of more than 900,000 square miles, or 2.5 million square kilometers. Lying in the center of Asia, encircled by the Earth's highest mountains, Tibet is a vast, arid plateau with an average altitude of 14,000 feet above sea level. The headwaters of Asia’s major rivers originate on the Tibetan plateau, which supply 85% of the population of Asia with water—approximately 47% of the world’s population! </p> <p> Tibet is comprised of the three provinces - Amdo, Kham, and U-Tsang. Amdo - the province where His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama was born - has been split by China into the provinces of Qinghai and part of Gansu. Kham is largely incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Gansu and Yunnan, and U-Tsang, together with western Kham, is today referred to by China as the “Tibet Autonomous Region” (TAR). Created by China in 1965 for its own political purpose, the TAR comprises less than half of historic Tibet. However, when Chinese officials and publications use the term "Tibet," they are referring only to TAR. </p> <img src="/images/tibet/tibet3-hi.92857409.jpg" class="img-responsive img-dropshadow img-inside" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-right:0px"> <p> Tibet’s spiritual leader is the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, Tenzin Gyatso, who was also Tibet’s political leader until stepping down from this position by his own request in 2011. Its government in exile is the Central Tibetan Administration, whose information you can find below. </p> <p> Tibetans themselves use the term Tibet to mean the three provinces described above, the area traditionally known as Tibet before the invasion in 1949-50. Despite over 60 years of Chinese occupation of Tibet, the Tibetan people refuse to be conquered and subjugated by China. The present Chinese policy - a combination of demographic and economic manipulation, discrimination, and violent oppression - has aimed to suppress the Tibetan issue by - unsuccessfully - trying to change the very character and the identity of Tibet and its people. </p> <p> Thus, their country occupied and their people oppressed, Tibetans are not simply working for human rights or religious freedom in Tibet - they are working to free their nation from a illegal and brutal foreign occupation by the largest nation on earth. </p> <h2 style="clear:left">Political History</h2> <img src="/images/tibet/tibet2-hi.4224bc99.jpg" class="img-responsive img-dropshadow img-inside"> <p> Before Chinese troops invaded Tibet in 1949, Tibet was a peaceful and independent nation. Tibet had its own government, its own language, its own currency, its own postal system and its own legal system. Thus it’s emphasized that “Free Tibet” does not just mean, “Make things better in Tibet.” It means, “Free the nation of Tibet from Chinese occupation.” </p> <p> Then, China’s People’s Liberation Army took Tibet by force. When Chairman Mao came to power in 1949, one of the first things he did was send his troops to annex Tibet. Tibet did not have a large or well-equipped army. While there was a determined armed resistance to the Chinese invasion, the relatively small Tibetan army was overwhelmed and crushed by the Chinese army. An agreement was imposed on the Tibetan government in May of 1951, acknowledging Chinese sovereignty over Tibet but recognizing the Tibetan government’s autonomy with respect to Tibet’s internal affairs. As the Chinese consolidated their control however, they repeatedly violated the treaty and open resistance to their rule grew. </p> <p> By 1959, the situation became even more dire. Thousands of Tibetan refugees poured into western Tibet from the east, where Tibetan resistance fighters were engaged in open battle with the Chinese army. Rumors that the Dalai Lama’s life was in danger began to circulate, leading to massive demonstrations in Tibet’s capital, Lhasa. </p> <img src="/images/tibet/tibet4-hi.d342f2e0.jpg" class="img-responsive img-dropshadow img-inside" style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-right:0px"> <p> On March 10th 1959, fearing that he would be secretly killed, hundreds of thousands of Tibetans massed around the Norbulingka Palace, the Dalai Lama’s summer residence, to prevent him - then only 24 years old - from attending an event to which the Chinese authorities had invited him. The demonstrators called for Tibetan independence and for Chinese forces to leave Tibet. Then on March 17, 1959, when the situation had become too dangerous for him to remain, the Dalai Lama fled under cover of darkness to India, where he has lived since. Tens of thousands of Tibetans were killed by Chinese forces who broke up the mass protests. </p> <p> Since 1959, Tibet has lived entirely under Chinese rule. The Tibetan people both inside Tibet and in exile long for the Dalai Lama to be able to safely return to Tibet, to resume his rightful place as Tibet’s leader. </p> <p> Millions of people around the world - Tibetan and non-Tibetan alike - have organized to support Tibet’s right to govern itself and exist entirely free of Chinese oppression and influence. To learn more about Tibet and its people, and how you can help, here are just a few of the many organizations working for Tibetan peace and freedom. </p> <br> <h2>International Organizations</h2> <p> <a class="linktitle" href="http://www.dalailama.com/messages/tibet">DalaiLama.com</a>, the website of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, also provides a wealth of information on the Dalai Lama’s own efforts including his speeches, messages and appeals to secure peace and freedom for Tibet, including his <a href="http://www.dalailama.com/messages/middle-way-approach">Middle Way</a> approach. </p> <p> <a class="linktitle" href="http://tibet.net/">The Central Tibetan Administration</a> is Tibet’s government in exile.
